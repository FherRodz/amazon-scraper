# amazon-scraper

## Description
This scraper functions but isnt perfect. As my first time making a web scraper this isnt a fancy job but rather a stitched job that works. Anyways ill provide guides as to how I intended to use it. This scraper takes information from the amazon store and saves it to a local csv file. The information it saves are the names, rating and price of the items from that amazon page. The page will always be the first page that comes up when you search for somehting in amazon. 

## How to use it
To make use of this scraper you just need to run the python script from your terminal. Then you will be asked to enter the item you would like to search for in the amazon store. After that just hit enter and the program should start parsing the amazon page HTML and saving the information to a csv file named "output-data.csv"

## A FIRST ITERATION
I intend to keep practicing web scraping with amazon and other web sites, so this project might change drastically in the future or maybe I create a new one. Either way if anyone that stumbles across this project wants to try it out and share their opinions or ideas, feel free to approach me.
